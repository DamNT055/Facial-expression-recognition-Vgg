# Lightweight facial expression recognition model
Author: Nguyễn Thanh Đảm - Nguyễn Phúc Nguyên Anh - Nguyễn Lê Phương Hà

Real-time Human Emotion Recognition From facial expressions. It uses a lightweight  deep Convolutional Neural Network.
The model is highly efficient, and with small size, that can be deployed on devices equipped with limited computational resources.

# Overview

Facial expression recognition (FER) is the task of classifying the expressions on face images into various categories such as anger, fear, surprise, sadness, happiness and so on. FER  is significant for human-computer interaction such as clinical practice and behavioral description.In this work, we propose a lightweight deep learning model based on VGGnet. The model used achieved an accuracy of 72% on the test data. The realtime analyzer assigns a suitable emoji for the current emotion.
